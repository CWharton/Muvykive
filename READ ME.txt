FOR PROACE

SETUP

Muvykive uses MySQL for a database and requires a schema called "muvykive". Run "muvykive.sql" to setup the database and input preset data.

If required I can migrate the data to SQLite, SQL Server or pretty much any popular relational database of your choosing. You have to love NHibernate for that one :).

If you have any problem please feel free to contact me on my mobile, 254.702.2043

Thank you, and I hope you enjoy the project.
